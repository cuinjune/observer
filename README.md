## Description

This repo is the week1 assignment of the "Hello, Computer: Unconventional Uses of Voice Technology" course at ITP.  
The assignment was to create something that takes non-speech input from a person and responds with speech synthesis.  

I decided to create an app that observes the user's face through the computer's camera, and speaks about it.

Here's the [Live Demo on Glitch](https://cuinjune-observer.glitch.me/).

## How it works



## Setup

1. You need to have [Python](https://realpython.com/installing-python/) installed on your computer
2. Run the following commands in the Terminal
```
git clone https://github.com/cuinjune/observer.git
cd observer
python -m http.server 8080
```
3. Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080
